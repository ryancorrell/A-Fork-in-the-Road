You begin on a path leading toward a forest.
A crying girl stops you and asks for your help. She has to deliver a package to her grandmother, but doesn't want to go into the woods.
You can choose Yes or No and choose which path you want to take. The choice is yours.
Deliver the package and get a reward.
